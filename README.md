Welcome to my **Terraform learning journey**! This repo documents my step-by-step progress as I explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform with AWS. Below you'll find a structured breakdown of topics covered each day.

---

## ğŸ“… Day 1: Getting Started with Terraform

### ğŸ”¹ Introduction to Terraform and IaC
- Understand the need for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Why Terraform? Multi-cloud, open-source, declarative

### ğŸ”¹ Installing Terraform on:
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows

### ğŸ”¹ Setting up Terraform for AWS
- Configuring AWS CLI and credentials
- Defining the AWS provider block in Terraform

### ğŸ”¹ Writing Your First Terraform Code
- Basic file structure: `main.tf`
- Writing your first resource block in HCL

### ğŸ”¹ Terraform Lifecycle
- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`

### ğŸ”¹ Launching an EC2 Instance
- Choosing AMI, instance type, tags
- Hands-on: Launch EC2 via Terraform

### ğŸ”¹ Terraform State Basics
- Understand `.tfstate`
- Importance of current vs. desired state

---

## ğŸ“… Day 2: Advanced Terraform Configuration

### ğŸ”¹ Understanding Providers and Resources
- What are providers?
- Resource definitions and lifecycle

### ğŸ”¹ Variables and Outputs
- Defining input variables
- Using `output` to extract useful data

### ğŸ”¹ Conditional Expressions & Functions
- `count`, `for_each`, `lookup`, etc.
- Conditional resource creation

### ğŸ”¹ Debugging & Formatting
- `terraform validate`
- `terraform fmt`
- Error tracing and troubleshooting

---

## ğŸ“… Day 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Modules

### ğŸ”¹ Creating Modular Infrastructure
- What are modules?
- Creating and using custom modules

### ğŸ”¹ Local Values and Data Sources
- `locals` for simplifying expressions
- Using `data` blocks to fetch external resource data

### ğŸ”¹ Module Variables and Inputs
- Passing variables to modules
- Input validation and defaults

### ğŸ”¹ Leveraging Module Outputs
- Accessing outputs from nested modules

### ğŸ”¹ Exploring Terraform Registry
- Using official & community-contributed modules
- Adding modules via source URLs

---

## ğŸ“… Day 4: Collaboration and State Management

### ğŸ”¹ Git & Version Control
- Git basics: `clone`, `pull`, `push`
- Best practices for Terraform in teams

### ğŸ”¹ Handling Sensitive Data
- `.gitignore`
- Avoid committing `.tfstate` or `terraform.tfvars`

### ğŸ”¹ Terraform Backends
- Local vs. remote state
- Benefits of remote state management

### ğŸ”¹ S3 Backend for State
- Setting up S3 for state storage
- Benefits in team collaboration

### ğŸ”¹ State Locking with DynamoDB
- Prevent concurrent changes
- DynamoDB as a locking mechanism

---

## ğŸ“… Day 5: Provisioning and Provisioners

### ğŸ”¹ Understanding Provisioners
- What are provisioners?
- When to use them (and when not to)

### ğŸ”¹ Local-exec vs Remote-exec
- Run commands locally or on remote resources

### ğŸ”¹ Provisioners on Create & Destroy
- Use case examples and implementation

### ğŸ”¹ Failure Handling
- `on_failure`, retries, timeouts

---

## ğŸ“… Day 6: Managing Environments with Workspaces

### ğŸ”¹ Introduction to Workspaces
- Concept of workspace isolation

### ğŸ”¹ Creating and Switching Workspaces
- `terraform workspace new <name>`
- `terraform workspace select <name>`

### ğŸ”¹ Using Workspaces for Environments
- Isolating dev/staging/prod states

---

## ğŸ“… Day 7: Security and Advanced Topics

### ğŸ”¹ Overview of HashiCorp Vault
- Secrets management overview

### ğŸ”¹ Terraform + Vault Integration
- Use Vault to manage AWS keys, secrets
- Example: fetching secrets from Vault dynamically

---

## ğŸ§  Why This Journey?

This 7-day roadmap helps me understand and practice real-world Terraform skills, especially in the context of cloud infrastructure management with AWS.
